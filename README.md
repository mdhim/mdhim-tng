MDHIM - Multi-Dimensional Hashing Indexing Middleware


Description
---------------
MDHIM is a parallel key/value store framework written in MPI.  
Unlike other big data solutions, MDHIM has been designed for an HPC 
environment and to take advantage of high speed networks.

**Note: This is not the Hexadimensional Hashing Indexing Middleware (HXHIM) repository.**

Requirements
---------------
LevelDB or MySQL as a database backend
- Leveldb: http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/
- Mysqldb: http://www.mysql.com/
- Mysqldb C Connector: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/

An MPI distribution that supports MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE and per-object locking of critical sections (this excludes OpenMPI).  We have had best results with MPICH: http://www.mpich.org/.  For mpich, compile with --enable-thread-cs=per-object.  If you get an error compiling, see if this patch helps: http://lists.mpich.org/pipermail/discuss/2014-May/002779.html .


Building the Library
---------------
1. Modify example.Makefile.cfg to point to your leveldb and MPI installations and save as Makefile.cfg
2. Type: make
3. If all went well, you have the library in src/libmdhim.a


Building the Tests
---------------
1. cd tests
2. Type: make
3. If all went well, you have all the tests compiled

Issues
---------------

With mysql you must remove the manifest file before running mdhim with a new set of paramters.


mdhimtst (mdhimtst.c)
---------------
Typical setup to run file: ./mdhimtst -ftest.txt -q -t5 -d3 -r0~2 -w1 -p ./

Typical batch file setup:

put single_insert.txt
get single_insertget.txt
del single_insertdel.txt

Batch command file setup:

For put get del bput bget bdel 
[command] [#of items in file(if necessary)] [file containg key and value (if necessary)] 

For nput ngetn (random numbers are generated for this function)
[#number of records to put/get] [key size (only applicapble for byte/strng)] [value size (nput only)] [size correctance number]

For flush (only command is used to flush)


Parameters:
 -f<BatchInputFileName> (file with batch commands)
 -d<DataBaseType> (Type of DB to use: levelDB=1 mysql=3)
 -t<IndexKeyType> (Type of keys: int=1, longInt=2, float=3, double=4, longDouble=5, string=6, byte=7)
 -p<pathForDataBase> (path where DB will be created)
 -n<DataBaseName> (Name of DataBase file or directory)
 -b<DebugLevel> (MLOG_CRIT=1, MLOG_DBG=2)
 -a (DB store append mode. By default records with same key are overwritten. This flag turns on the option to append to existing values.
 -w<Rank modlus> This flag turns on the option to either allow or deny threads to do command based on if it is dividiable by the modlus of the modulus number
 -r<lowest rank number> ~ <highest rank number>This flag turns on the option to either allow or deny threads to do command based on if the rank falls inclusively inbetween the rank ranges.  NOTE: You must use the '~' inbetween the numbers.  Example: -r0~2
 -q<0|1> (Quiet mode, default is verbose) 1=write out to log file
